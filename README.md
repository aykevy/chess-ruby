# Chess (Ruby Version)
This chess application allows a user to play chess on the user console. It behaves and follows the rules of chess including moves like castling and en passant. This application was developed to test my abilities in learning an very different language from what people usually use. What better way is there to learn a language in depth than making a fun board game such as chess?

## Language
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Tools
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - A standalone source code editor that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The top pick for JavaScript and web developers, with extensions to support just about any programming language.
